# hackathon-24-3 Marco

Repository for the 24.3 hackathon

* Fixed a potential breaking change introduce by Navigation Access Control
  https://github.com/vaadin/flow/pull/18176
  Credits goes to @SebastianKuehnau that opened the Pandora Box
* Tested the DTO support in a Hilla application running on Quarkus
  The application is in this repo and can be run using `./mvnw quarkus:dev`
  It uses [quarkus-hilla-react]() extension and it has been developed following the
  [quick started guide](https://github.com/mcollovati/quarkus-hilla/wiki/QuickStart-react), but using AutoCrud and
  DTOs instead of JPA entities.
