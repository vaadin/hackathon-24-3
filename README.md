# From Tatu

- Found that the old AppNav / AppNavItem based on vcf-nav do not work with Vaadin 24.3 anymore. I did not find the root cause and refactored my demo to use SideNav instead.

- Tested that my add-ons BeanTable, ColorPicker, CircularProgressBar, LumoGridLayout, TwinColSelect, Badge, Tree and TwinColSelect still work with Vaadin 24.3 correctly. No changes were needed in the add-on's to work.
