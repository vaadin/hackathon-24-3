The idea was add as much tests as possible to a flow application downloaded from https://start.vaadin.com, by using the new vaadin plugin ui-test-generator

While playing with different options of parsers and generators, I realised some improvementes it could be performed to the plugin, I I implemented those and committed the following changes:

- Generated TestBench tests didn't include the login process, it has been implemented in thid [commit](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/d2e8f350e556a9b625341474b9fa66eb1facfd5c) 

- HTML used in OpenAI prompts were very verbose, increasing the number of tokens and time of AI response, I added a [commit](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/ed1c88bfc5f66651def5cc7665888522fb90fec0) to optimize html size. At the same time I did some [refactoring](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/45182cc0819bfc04a05dd93e219d7763f2f47c6c) to the OpenAI Generator, and to the [base](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/36b946b18a7453ffeabc9b3fe4346b38af9a7857) class used for PlayWright tests

- The JDT parser was not supporting the login process, and it was fixed in this [commit](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/5f4e724926f89897ed5e04470a3255e75721ed2f), so as generated tests can perform the login process before selecting the tested view.

- Generated PlayWright tests using JDT parser, and generator, now support login in the setup with this [commit](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/26fa84f0fbf74d47f70c9a42720e57f7ee5b53e1).

- And finally, I was able to [reuse](https://github.com/vaadin/ui-test-generator/commit/b0bcb1dbdc313777d68a0b15a5a4488ba921e2b5) Json file generated by parsers, so as user can incrementally implement tests in the application, by parsing view by view. Otherwise it's impossible to visit all views in a big application without reaching OpenAI billing limits.
