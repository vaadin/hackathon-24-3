# hackathon-24-3
Kriss project for the 24.3 hackathon

## What I did:
- Created simple Vaadin Flow app with 3 views and 2 error handling views - home, admin and map view. 
- Created an issue for MultiSelectComboBox - https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/issues/6904
- Played with @AccessDeniedErrorRouter and custom error pages for different pages and changing roles on the fly
- Played with Map and MapView  with getting the current location and adding markers and adding them to MultiSelectComboBox
